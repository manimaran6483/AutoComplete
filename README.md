AS the API has very large data, it takes some time to fetch and display.

CURL COMMAND : curl https://manimaran.pythonanywhere.com

API=> I have built the API in flask using FLaskRESTful.
I took all the english words and converted to json format and included in  the api
I have deployed this api in "https://manimaran.pythonanywhere.com" for easy use.

FrontEnd : Used HTML,CSS, JavaScript.

I have used one input field, icon and a div element to show suggestions
The data from API is fetched using async fetch function.
Using Regular Expression i have matched the input to the words to provide suggestion words.
Also added some CSS to the input field.
